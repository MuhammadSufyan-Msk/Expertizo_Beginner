Add 1/4 tsp turmeric powder, 1/4 tsp red chili powder, 1/4 tsp garam masala, 1/4 tsp cumin powder, and salt to taste. Mix well and cook for 2-3 minutes. Add 1/2 chopped tomato, 1 slit green chili, 1 tbsp chopped coriander leaves, and 1 tbsp chopped mint leaves. Cook until the tomatoes soften.

    <h3>Recipe</h3>
    <p>
        Start by heating 1 tbsp oil or ghee in a small pot and sauté 1/2 thinly sliced onion until golden. Add 1/2 tbsp ginger-garlic paste and cook for a minute. Then, add 125g beef pieces (cut into small cubes) and cook until they brown slightly. Add 1/4 tsp turmeric powder, 1/4 tsp red chili powder, 1/4 tsp garam masala, 1/4 tsp cumin powder, and salt to taste. Mix well and cook for 2-3 minutes. Add 1/2 chopped tomato, 1 slit green chili, 1 tbsp chopped coriander leaves, and 1 tbsp chopped mint leaves. Cook until the tomatoes soften. Now, add 1/2 cup basmati rice (rinsed and drained) and mix gently. Pour in 1.5 cups water (since beef takes longer to cook), stir, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover with a tight lid, and let it simmer for 30-40 minutes until the beef is tender and the rice is fully cooked. Turn off the heat and let it rest for 5 minutes <br>

    <h2 id="Y.Pulao">AKHNI PULAO</h2>
    <h3>Recipe</h3>
    <p>
        Start by preparing the yakhni (broth): In a pot, add 125g bone-in chicken or beef, 1 cup water, 1/2 onion (quartered), 1/2 tbsp ginger-garlic paste, 1/2 tsp whole spices (1 bay leaf, 2-3 cloves, 1 cardamom pod, 1 small cinnamon stick), and salt to taste. Boil for 20-25 minutes (or 40 minutes for beef) until the meat is tender and the broth is flavorful. Strain the broth and set aside, keeping the meat aside. In a small pot, heat 1 tbsp oil or ghee and sauté 1/2 thinly sliced onion until golden. Add the cooked meat and fry for 2-3 minutes. Add 1/2 cup basmati rice (rinsed and drained) and gently mix. Pour in the prepared yakhni (adjust to 1 cup liquid), stir, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover with a tight lid, and let it simmer for 15-20 minutes until the rice is fully cooked. Turn off the heat and let it rest for 5 minutes. <br>
